##Blocitoff: a self-destructing to-do list
  
  Blocitoff is my second Rails project at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). It is intended to allow users to create a free account, sign in, and make to-do lists that clear items out for you after a week so they don't get too cluttered!
  
  Right now I'm just getting started on the controllers and views of the site. Users can now log in and reset their password via their email through the Devise gem, and there are views for the Home page, and the To-Do List (though you can only access the To-Do List view by creating an account).
